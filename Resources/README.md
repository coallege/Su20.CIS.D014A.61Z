# Resources

This is for miscellaneous files that are included in the course.
There were more but I didn't really need most of them.

There was a document describing the names of certain objects but it turns out
that there's a name for the weird hungarian notation:
[Leszynski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leszynski_naming_convention)

I plan to never use it again.
