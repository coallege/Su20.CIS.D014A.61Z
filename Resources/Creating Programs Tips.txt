Creating Computer Programs

1. Use arithmetic analogies to create logic.
2. Always consider boundary conditions of logic.
3. Think through algorithm using desk checking approaches.
4. Test program after writing pieces of a logical section.
5. Use data driven algorithms for flexibility.
6. Always comment a logical section of code "what" or "why".
7. Thoroughly test the program created.
8. Include mechanisms for user to understand how to work the program.
